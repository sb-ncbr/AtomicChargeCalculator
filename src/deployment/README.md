# Deployment
How to use the *Deploy to Production* GitHub Action to deploy new ACC II version is described [here](../../docs/deployment/README.md).

## Nginx

`nginx.conf` provides a configuration that can be used to deploy ACC II using nginx. Reusable declarations are located in `./snippets` to avoid unnecessary duplicity.

## SSL Configuration
Simple way is to use certbot (Let's Encrypt):

```bash 
$ certbot --nginx -d <url>
```

## Setup Using Docker
A quicker way of running ACC II locally is to use `docker compose`. This will start up 3 containers for API, web and database.

*Note:* If you are using Windows, you might encounter the following error during `api` container startup:
```
exec /acc/entrypoint.sh: no such file or directory
```

This is because of line endings and can be fixed by running `dos2unix` on the `src/backend/entrypoint.sh` file.

### Prepare base ChargeFW2 image
We firstly need to build the base ChargeFW2 image which is used by the api container:
```bash
$ cd ../../
$ docker build -t chargefw2-base:local -f ./src/backend/Dockerfile.chargefw2 .
```

### Start
Use `-d` if you want the containers to start in the background.

```bash 
$ cd ./src/deployment
$ docker compose up -d
```

### Stop
```bash
$ docker compose down
```

### Production startup
In order to run compose in production mode, you need to specify which compose files should be used:

```bash
$ docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

*Notes*: 
- This will not work locally as the frontend app will try to make requests to the production server.
- Environment variable `PROD_DB_PASSWORD` needs to be specified (any password).

### Compose Files
- `docker-compose.yml` base configuration.
- `docker-compose.override.yml` development configuration. Is used automatically.
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` production configuration. Needs to be explicitly specified (as described above)
